Following the recent hurricane, people around the world are using the [OpenStreetMap](http://tasks.hotosm.org) platform to give their time to hurricane relief efforts. The Red Cross in Puerto Rico has requested two tasks we can help with for their relief efforts. During the mapathon, we will teach people how to help with these efforts through mapping, and we will map together.

Come help with relief efforts on the ground in Puerto Rico by contributing
your time to open-source mapping.

No mapping experience necessary. No knowledge of local terrain is necessary.
Come any time during the afternoon. This [short video](https://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/) can introduce you to the OSM mapping work

Please bring your laptop & RSVP to agil@columbia.edu
